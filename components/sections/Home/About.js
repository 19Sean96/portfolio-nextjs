              Art has always been a passion of mine that i used to pass the time
              & distract me from real work. i became really interested in
              painting and used that to exercise my creativity, although I never
              imagined that i could make a profession from it.

              I’ve been using computers as early as 3 years old when I would
              play educational games. I owned my own computer at the age of 6.
              however, it wouldn’t be until high school when i would experiment
              with graphic design & html/css.

              until 2014 when i moved to phoenix, i didn’t have too much
              direction. it was around this time I discovered that web
              development was a serious industry which happened to combine my
              two favorite subjects: art & tech.

              fast forward to 2019, and here we are. I am very passionate about
              creating beautiful web experiences, and I sincerely look forward
              to discussing future collaborations.

              my creativity is heavily inspired by artists such as Jean-michel
              basquiat, andy warhol & picasso. I have an appreciation for
              minimalist design & abstract art. I’m excited to see how the web
              will evolve over the next decade & i am determined to be a part of
              that growth.
