              Understanding & visualizing what is important - this is the first
              step that both Design & Development fundamentally share. With
              endless opportunity for creating experiences on the web, a
              targeted vision is needed to avoid wasting time and focus on the
              most impactful factors to the application end-goal.

              To me, being able to visualize an application architecture and
              understand its impact on future development is indistinguishable
              to visualizing a design language for a web-app or website and
              understand how the user experience will be impacted.

              With proven capabilities in mathematics & creative design, I see
              myself as being ambidextrous to both creative & technical work.
              Neutral to either department, I enjoy acting as the translator
              between technical & creative teams.

              Communication is essential to success in any industry, and it’s a
              hard, dynamic skill to master, yet one that returns dividends. It
              impacts business operations, marketing, development timeframes,
              and so much more. My role is to be that impact through
              transparency, cooperation & understanding audiences.

              Original ideas are nothing more than a “mixing” of pre-existing
              ideas to create something brand new - an innovation. Meaning, an
              original idea is only as good as the existing ideas the thinker
              was already exposed to.

              I’m passionate about diversifying the ideas I’m exposed to.
              Whether that be peaking through history, sharing a conversation of
              ideals with someone from a different country, or simply watching
              nature documentaries, everything leaves an impact on how I
              approach life and work. I love digesting what I observe & finding
              analogies that seem to make more sense when combined with
              otherwise unrelated topics.
